# EcommerceShop
This is an E-commerce website build with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It is a dynamic and responsive(pc, notebook, tablet, smartphone) website , that allows you to navigate on pages and through products.

You can add products to your cart and modify your cart, and every product that is opened by the customer displays a product page with details that is gnerated by a JS script by remembering the ID of the clicked product. 

I have used the browsers local storage to remember the IDs of the cart products and the opened products, therefore even if the pages are reloaded , the cart display will be as you left it.
