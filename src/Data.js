    desc2: `<pre>ISO-XP is a high protein supplement with sweetener and by far the cleanest and highest quality
 Whey Protein Isolate available, with only 0.1g Lactose per 25g serving. Basically there is no other protein, 
 anywhere, which exceeds this level of clinical protein per 100g ratio - with 23.4g of protein per 25g serving.
  ISO-XP is made from exceedingly fresh EU, sweet dairy whey that is isolated and then spray dried. ISO-XP has
   NO SOY added and instead uses Sunflower Lecithin as the Emulsifier.

ISO-XP is ideal for anyone looking to increase daily protein intake without any additional fats, carbohydrate or sugars.
 ISO-XP should be mixed with water or skimmed milk for easy mixing and great taste.

KEY BENEFITS
0g Sugar (per 25g serving)
0g Carbs (per 25g serving)
0g Lactose (per 25g serving)
0g Soya
0g Fat (per 25g serving)
Gluten free
23.4g Protein (per 25g serving)

Halal Certified Product

 <strong>  SUGGESTED USE </strong>
Mix 1 scoop (approximately 25g) with 200ml of water or skimmed milk.
Use 1-3 servings daily, depending on your protein requirements.
ISO-XP is rapidly absorbed, so the optimal times to use it are when you need protein fast.
 This includes immediately upon waking before breakfast, and immediately after exercise.
  After training, many athletes take a double serving (50g) as the body is able to process a larger amount of protein in its
   depleted state. </pre> `,

                           Use 1-3 servings daily, depending on your protein requirements.
                           ISO-XP is rapidly absorbed, so the optimal times to use it are when you need protein fast.
                            This includes immediately upon waking before breakfast, and immediately after exercise.
                             After training, many athletes take a double serving (50g) as the body is able to process a larger amount of protein in its
                              depleted state. </pre> `,

                                             Mix 1 scoop (approximately 25g) with 200ml of water or skimmed milk.

                                             ISO-XP is rapidly absorbed, so the optimal times to use it are when you need protein fast.

                                               After training, many athletes take a double serving (50g) as the body is able to process a larger amount of protein in its
