    <h2>ISO-XP :</h2> 
High protein supplement with sweetener and by far the cleanest and highest quality
Whey Protein Isolate available, with only 0.1g Lactose per 25g serving. Basically there is no other protein, 
anywhere, which exceeds this level of clinical protein per 100g ratio - with 23.4g of protein per 25g serving.
ISO-XP is made from exceedingly fresh EU, sweet dairy whey that is isolated and then spray dried. ISO-XP has
NO SOY added and instead uses Sunflower Lecithin as the Emulsifier.

ISO-XP is ideal for anyone looking to increase daily protein intake without any additional fats, carbohydrate or sugars.
ISO-XP should be mixed with water or skimmed milk for easy mixing and great taste.

0g Lactose (per 25g serving)<br>

<h1>SUGGESTED USE</h1>
Mix 1 scoop (approximately 25g) with 200ml of water or skimmed milk.
Use 1-3 servings daily, depending on your protein requirements.
ISO-XP is rapidly absorbed, so the optimal times to use it are when you need protein fast.
This includes immediately upon waking before breakfast, and immediately after exercise.
After training, many athletes take a double serving (50g) as the body is able to process a larger amount of protein in its
depleted state. </div> `,

    When it comes to the highest quality source of protein for bodybuilders, 
    there’s little disagreement that whey protein isolate tops the list and ticks all the boxes.

It’s highly bio available in muscle building amino acids, rapidly digesting and easy to consume.
 The problem? Too many whey isolates on the market today contain an abundance of sugar and fat, 
 placing more emphasis on flavor as opposed to overall quality. That all changes with Shadowhey Isolate.<br><br>

Shadowhey Isolate contains only the purest, cross-flow micro filtered whey isolate protein. 
It goes through a rigorous filtration process that ensures you’re left with only the highest quality, 
bio available whey protein isolate on the market ever created. As proof of its potency,
 Shadowhey Isolate contains 0 grams of sugar and 0 grams of fat per serving — unparalleled when compared to other products in its category.<br><br>

Shadowhey Isolate is perfect for post-workout consumption when you need a rapid source of protein 
first thing in the morning or in between meals. Its highly bio available source of amino acids blasts protein synthesis
 through the roof, leading to increased muscular gains and recovery from strenuous high-intensity training. 
 When it comes to choosing a whey protein isolate, the choice is clear and there’s only really one competitor:
  Shadowhey Isolate, Dorian’s much-needed stamp on the whey protein market.

<h2>Hydro Whey Zero</h2> is a combined whey protein drink powder with a protein content of 80%. 
The composition of the protein also contains, besides hydrolysed whey protein and whey isolate sources,
 added L-glutamine and L-arginine amino acids. The decomposition of hydrolysed whey protein – due to h
 ydrolysis (a pre-digestion process) – is easier and quicker for our body. The glutamine and arginine 
 amino acids added to the whey protein complex are nutrients produced by our body, still, they belong to
  the category of conditionally essential amino acids. It means that in certain circumstances, such as an 
  exhausting workout session, they need to be supplemented.<br>

1 Per serving (22 g):<br>

18 g protein<br>

3.7 g BCAA<br>

with added L-glutamine and L-arginine amino acids<br>


<h2>Who is Hydro Whey Zero recommended to?</h2>

those seeking a source of fast-absorbing milk-based proteins
those who want to support their recovery with protein powder after workout, as, due to its protein content, it contributes to maintaining muscle mass and healthy bones, as well as to muscle mass growth
those sensitive to gluten
 

<h2>HOW WHEY PROTEIN HYDROSILATE IS MADE</h2>

Hydrolysed whey protein (WPH) is a pre-digested and partially hydrolysed protein powder. During hydrolysis, special enzymes are used to break down protein chains to peptides, which results in a faster digestion and absorption of the given formula.


<h2>WHY YOU NEED PROTEINS</h2>

Protein is an essential building block of our body, a source of nutrients made up from amino acids produced by our body and supplemented from external sources. It contributes to maintaining muscles during workout, a diet and your everyday life. You need more protein if you regularly exercise, if you want to increase your muscle mass and as you get older.

Like all BioTech USA products, Hydro Whey Zero consists of safe and carefully selected ingredients.</div>`,
